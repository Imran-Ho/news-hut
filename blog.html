    <h1 class="my-5">Some most important Questions' answers are given below</h1>
    <h3 class="m-3">1) What is the difference in each (Var,Let and Const) ? </h3>
    <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope.One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration.</p>
    <h3 class="m-3">2) What is the difference between Arrow function and Regular Function ? </h3>
    <p>There are two major benefits of using Arrow functions. One is that it's a shorter syntax and thus requires less code. The main benefit is that it removes the several pain points associated with the this operator</p>
    <h3 class="m-3">3) What is the difference in each of Map,forEach,filter and find ? </h3>
    <p>The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by applying the callback function on each element of an array, while the forEach method doesn't return anything.The only difference is the filter() method search through all the elements while find() method search through all the child elements only.</p>
    <h3 class="m-3">4) Why is the Template String used ? </h3>
    <p>Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).</p>
